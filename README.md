**How to build a motion detector with Arduino**

This is the demonstration to show you how to build a motion detector with Arduino. 
The system detects the presence of a movement within its detection range and sends a signal to Arduino. 
Then Arduino lights up the LED when the motion signal is received.

*Please read the PDF (How to Build a Motion Detector with Arduino) for more details.*
